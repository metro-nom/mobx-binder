# Rendering a form

As the whole binder is only about state, you are free in how to render components for all Binder fields using the framework of your choice.

For rendering a form, best practice is to create form field wrapper components.

Please also see the [example implementation](packages/sample/src/app/forms/FormField.tsx) which integrates with [reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/) components.
