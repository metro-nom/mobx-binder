# Getting Started

If you decide for using mobx-binder, there are some flavors to choose from:

Binder
The core *Binder* tries to be as independent as possible of validation and translation frameworks. If you already have some of those frameworks in use, you might want to use only the core components and integrate it.

SimpleBinder
This binder does not care about localization. Use this you donâ€™t need translations or your validation framework of choice already provides translated error messages. *SimpleBinder* is part of the *mobx-binder-core* module

DefaultBinder
The *DefaultBinder* already makes assumptions about the translation library, which should support ES2015 templating style keys and named arguments, like [i18n-harmony](https://www.npmjs.com/package/i18n-harmony) and [react-mobx-i18n](https://github.com/jverhoelen/react-mobx-i18n). For that scenario, it already provides a set of ready-to-use Validators and Converters. All this is part of the *mobx-binder* module.

To illustrate the power of the framework, most examples in this documentation are using the *DefaultBinder*.


## Packages

Depending on your needs, you might want to install from the following packages:

| Package name       | Description                                                                                                                                             |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| mobx-binder        | Contains the DefaultBinder. Also re-exports `mob-binder-core`, so if you want to use the Default Binder, there is no need to additionally depend on it. |
| mobx-binder-core   | Core package containing Binder and SimpleBinder.                                                                                                        |
| mobx-binder-moment | Converters and validators for DefaultBinder supporting [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com)                                                                |
| mobx-binder-dayjs  | Converters and validators for DefaultBinder supporting [Day.js](https://day.js.org)                                                                     |

## Installation

**Sample install using NPM:**

``` bash
npm install --save mobx-binder mobx-binder-dayjs
```

**Sample install using YARN**

``` bash
yarn add mobx-binder mobx-binder-dayjs
```

## MobX Configuration

In general, *mobx-binder* should work flawlessly with all kinds [MobX configuration settings](https://mobx.js.org/configuration.html).

Please note that - depending on your actual use case - you will get warnings in the browser console when setting `reactionRequiresObservable` to `true`, as some computed properties and actions just might not need to access observable state. We recommend disabling that setting (which corressponds to the default) in productive environments.
