# Conditional visibility

If a field should be hidden as part of a value change of a different field, it may become necessary to remove that field from the Binder completely, especially if itâ€™s value is currently invalid and would prevent a form submission:

``` typescript
binder.removeBinding(fullName)
```

This updates the global validation status based on the fields that are left.


{/* TODO add support to re-adding bindings without having to re-build them */}
